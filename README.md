Kaggle House Prices Competition

OK, so I submitted my first Kaggle entry.  Placed in the bottom half, but I don't feel too bad about that, because
- It was my very first entry
- I intentionally limited myself to linear models on the first try, even after seeing that others had had more success with tree models
- I didn't make any attempts to tune fitting algorithms, just chose the one with the best off-the-shelf results
- I didn't bother to use an ensemble of models or fitting methods, just chose my favorite from the linear options
- I cut corners in the interest of getting it done: e.g. treat ordered data as continuous without any attempt to find the right ratios
- The most successful models in this competition don't do dramatically better than typical entries


Here's [my original plan](plan.md) FWIW.
